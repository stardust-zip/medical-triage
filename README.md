# TriageOS

TriageOS is an independent portfolio project for AI-assisted specialty routing with a human-in-the-loop review queue. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to any real hospital or clinic network.

All seed data, demo doctors, demo clinics, and patient examples are synthetic. Do not use real PHI or real patient data in local development, tests, demos, logs, prompts, or hosted environments.

## How to Run the Project (Windows & Linux)

This guide provides instructions to set up and run the AI Server (Backend) and the Next.js application (Frontend) on both Windows and Linux environments.

## Prerequisites

* **Docker & Docker Compose**: Required for the backend services.
    * *Windows*: Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
    * *Linux*: Install Docker Engine and the Docker Compose plugin.
* **Node.js & Package Manager**: Required for the Next.js frontend. Install Node.js and your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun).

## 1. Environment Setup (Both OS)

Before running the application, you must configure your environment variables:

1.  In the root directory of the project, locate the `.env.example` file.
2.  Create a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`.
3.  Open `.env` and fill in your required API keys and database connection string:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
    LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
    LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
    LANGFUSE_HOST="[https://cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com)"
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/triageos
    ```

## 2. Running the Backend (AI Server)

The backend runs inside a Docker container using the `api` service and exposes port `8000`. 

### On Linux (Using Makefile)

Linux systems natively support `make` utilities. You can use the provided `Makefile` to manage the Docker containers:

* **Start the server:** `make up` (Runs `docker compose up -d`)
* **View live logs:** `make logs`
* **Stop the server:** `make down`
* **Rebuild the Docker image:** `make build`
* **Access the container shell:** `make shell`

### On Windows

Windows does not include the `make` utility by default in PowerShell or Command Prompt. You should run the underlying Docker Compose commands directly:

* **Start the server:** `docker compose up -d`
* **View live logs:** `docker compose logs -f api`
* **Stop the server:** `docker compose down`
* **Rebuild the Docker image:** `docker compose build`
* **Access the container shell:** `docker exec -it vinuni-ai-agent bash`

*(Tip: If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) or Git Bash, you can use the Linux `make` commands).*

## 3. Running the Frontend (Next.js)

The steps to run the frontend are identical for both Windows and Linux.

1.  Open a new terminal or command prompt window.
2.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(Note: You can also use `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`)*
4.  Start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
